# ðŸŽµ Deezer Music Downloader & Converter

This Python tool lets you **search for or paste Deezer links** to download tracks in **FLAC**, then automatically:

* Convert to **WAV** (16-bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo) and **MP3** (320 kbps)
* Generate a `about.txt` file with detailed audio metadata (via ffprobe)
* Pack everything neatly into a ZIP archive

It uses **deemix** for downloading and **ffmpeg**/**ffprobe** for processing â€” with a nice progress bar in the console.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

### Python packages

```bash
pip install deemix colorama tqdm
```

### Binaries

You need `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` in a `bin` folder inside the project directory:

```
project/
â”œâ”€ bin/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ffmpeg.exe
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ffprobe.exe
â”œâ”€ get.py
```

Download them from:

* [FFmpeg official builds](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Clone this repository** or download the script.
2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install deemix colorama tqdm
   ```
3. **Place ffmpeg & ffprobe** into the `bin` folder.
4. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. Script asks for **Deezer link** or **search query**.
2. If a search query is entered:

   * Searches Deezer API (tracks & albums)
   * Lets you pick a result
3. Downloads **FLAC** via `deemix`
4. Converts FLAC â†’ WAV + MP3
5. Creates **about.txt** with audio info
6. Packs all into a ZIP in `Complete/` folder

## ðŸ“‚ Output Structure

For each track, youâ€™ll get:

```
TrackName.zip
 â”œâ”€ TrackName.flac
 â”œâ”€ TrackName.wav
 â”œâ”€ TrackName.mp3
 â”œâ”€ TrackName_about.txt
```

## ðŸ›  Notes

* Works **offline** after initial installation
* If you skip installing `colorama`/`tqdm`, script will still work but without colors and progress bars
* **Legal reminder**: Make sure you have rights to download the music
